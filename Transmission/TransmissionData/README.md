This folder contains the files with the transmission coefficient data to be used to determine b0 and b1 terms for the
stochastic charge project, besides for the principal part integral in b0 (which is done with another code).
It contains data for the following masses:
1e21 Planck masses
2e21 Planck masses
4e21 Planck masses
8e21 Planck masses
The parameters are as follows:
k=[-5,-4,-3,-2,-1,1,2,3,4,5]
Z=[-2,-1,0,1,2] (for Y=0)
Y=[-2,-1,0,1,2] (for Z=0)
rmax=10^6 * BH mass
nstep=1.81*10^6
e-folds=26.6

For "non-fine" files:
